All contributions are welcome as long as you 

* format your code with cargo fmt
* use english language in comments
* know how to code good code and don't know how to code bad code
* are anyone
* love rust or league of legends (that one can be omitted most of the times)

# Jokes aside
This library heavily uses bleeding-edge Rust features such as `async/await` syntax 
that right now is available only on a nightly toolchain and crates which are fetched directly from 
their github master branches. It is ***NOT*** recommended to try and contribute if you are not already familiar 
with the mess that is the current state of async in Rust.
